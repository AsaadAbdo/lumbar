# Scope Plugin #

## Introduction ##

The _global_ flag controls the scoping rules that are applied by the scope plugin. For example, some code doesnâ€™t like when its loaded within a scope object. This is particularly true usually for browser focused 3rd party libraries. With this flag set, it will force the library to be loaded as normal.
